# Singleton

This is a simple c# program to demonstrate the use of a Singleton.  There is a simple singleton class that accumulates a list of strings.  
This singleton is used in a simple class that has a name property, and that logs to the singleton a string for the creation of that class.
As demonstrated in the program, the singleton instance is only create once and holds all the logs for all the classes.
